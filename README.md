# Multiclass-ONE-V-S-REST-Classifier---MNIST
A multiclass classification model on MNIST data using the One-vs-Rest (OvR) approach involves distinguishing between multiple classes by breaking down the problem into a series of binary classifications. MNIST, a dataset of handwritten digits (0-9), is used to train the model.  This method is effective for handling multiclass classification.
